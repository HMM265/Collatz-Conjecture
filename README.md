# Collatz Conjecture
# made in python 3
I saw a video on the Collatz Conjecture and I thought that I could make it in python so I did. You start by picking a number and if that number is odd you times it by three then add one, if the number is even you divide by two.
odd = 3x + 1
even = x / 2
No matter what number you pick it will always reach one and get stuck in an infinte loop of (3 * 1 + 1), (4 / 2) , (2 / 2) which then would become one again and restart the loop.
